            <h3><a href="flamingo-analysis.pdf">Flamingo Analysis Essay</a></h3>
            <p>
                The flamingo analysis was an on demand essay we wrote in AP Lang. 
                It was my favorite prompt and when given the chance to revise 
                one of our essays to try to improve it I chose this one. The 
                flamingo analysis responds to a prompt about how Jennifer Price used pink flamingos to address United States Culture.

            <h3><a href="enzyme-temp-lab-report.pdf">Enzyme Temperature Lab</a></h3>
            <p>
                One of the many lab reports I have done in the past two years during my lab science classes.

            <h3><a href="personal-essay.pdf">Common App Personal Essay</a></h3>
            <p>
                The essay I wrote for the common app prompt. There were more than a few revisions but I am really happy with the final product. It focuses on three different cardboard props I own and the aspects of myself they represent.

            <h3><a href="values-essay.pdf">Values Essay</a></h3>
            <p>
                I wrote this in 9th grade for english. At the time I thought it was one of my better writing peices. Comparing this essay to my common app is a striking difference. It shows both the great strides I have had in my writing ability and the way my values have shifted over highschool.
