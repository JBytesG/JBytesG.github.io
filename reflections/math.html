        <h2>Math Reflection</h2>
        <p class="refelection">
            Math is one of my favorite subjects. I seek it out in my free time and always try to engage with it whenever
            possible. Since I find math so fun, I have gone above and beyond in the classes I have taken. In high
            school, I have taken math up to the last class at OWL: Pre-Calc, AP Calc, and AP Stats. I also took AP CSP
            as a math elective in 9th grade. My math experience has been all that I would hope for, informative in math
            itself, helpful in learning critical thinking and problem solving, and a good chance to work with my peers.
            <br><br>
            My favorite math class at OWL was AP Stats by far. Although I enjoyed every math class AP Stats had an open
            format and real-world applications that no other class had. Since it was an AP class it was also more
            difficult than most classes which meant that studying and working with peers was extremely helpful and very
            necessary. AP Stats’ focus on real-world applications made it even more interesting and memorable than a
            usual math class. Outside of class, I was able to apply things I was learning to solidify my understanding
            and have fun with what I was learning. Although the class itself was lecture-based we were able to have
            whole class discussions about the concepts we were working with regularly. That helped to cultivate a more
            welcoming class experience and a better learning environment.
            <br><br>
            Math has been a great place for me to collaborate with others during high school. I love helping people and
            since math is something that comes easily to me I can often help with math. For the past two years, I have
            been tutoring younger students in math as well as helping my friends. Helping others see what I see in math
            is extremely fun and it helps me to develop stronger relationships with younger students and my peers. Math
            was also the first subject I started doing study groups for. In AP Calc it was required so I would work with
            my assigned group over a google meet sometimes but once we were back in person I realized just how good it
            was. Working with other people helped me to see things I hadn’t before and find new ways to solve problems.
            It felt like I had a better understanding of a concept when I explained it so someone or they explained it
            to me. Working with other people brought my math to the next level.
            <br><br>
            Showing my work in math is something I really struggled to learn. I work really well with numbers in my head
            but explaining the process of how I did it was very hard for me. That meant that until I got to AP Calc I
            rarely showed my work on math problems. My teachers constantly told me to show my work and I did sometimes
            but I didn’t like to. As I started to get to higher-level classes I was forced to write things down more and
            more because problems started getting more complicated and I could not remember every part at once. The more
            I showed what I was doing the easier it became. I wish I had started sooner but now I have learned to show
            how I work through problems and I make fewer mistakes because I can see them better on paper.
            <br><br>
            I love math. I am very happy with the opportunities I have had at OWL to experience it. Math has taught me a
            lot about problem-solving and working with people that I couldn’t have found anywhere else. The classes I
            have taken for math were some of my favorites and I plan on seeking out many like them in the future.
