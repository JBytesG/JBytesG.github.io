        <h2>Science and Tech Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            Science and technology are very important parts of my life. I would like to go into a career in science and
            tech and I love learning about and doing things focused on them. At OWL I have done a lot in both science
            and tech areas. I have taken Bio, Chem, AP Bio, and now APES and Physics for my science classes. I also took
            Engineering I when it was offered, took the engineering interim in 2021, and I work with Rhonda on tech
            issues for my TA. Various projects I have worked on include getting rid of outdated tech, organizing tech
            storage, and setting up the hardware and software to stream school events.
            <br><br>
            The science classes at OWL have been very engaging and have helped me to develop my love for science. The
            lab-based sciences have been especially helpful with a focus on learning through doing and becoming a better
            technical writer. Labs are a great way to apply what I learn in class and test out my understanding. I
            learned far faster and more permanently than I otherwise would have with just a textbook and notes. They
            helped to fuel my curiosity and encourage me to engage in the scientific process more thoroughly. Writing
            lab reports improved my ability to write about numbers and data drastically. It also made me better at
            reading and understanding data which could help me with a job but will certainly help me understand news
            articles or papers better.
            <br><br>
            My TA and helping with technology have been a big part of my more recent time at OWL. The opportunity to
            both help people with tech issues they are having as well as improve our use of tech has been amazing. It
            has helped me to communicate better and given me a chance to help our community by doing something I am good
            at. I have been working on sorting and organizing the tech storage spaces and I have been able to find many
            things that we no longer need and things that we have needed. Working with streaming so that people could
            attend events virtually was extremely fun and a great challenge. I learned a lot about the hardware needed
            for streaming as well as more about how sound and video signals work.
            <br><br>
            Science and technology at OWL has challenged me to work outside of my comfort zone. I have taken many nature
            focused science classes at OWL. Although I love nature and studying it when I do a lab I always want things
            to work. Nature introduces another variable that I have no control over that can make experiments fail.
            Working past the idea that the data we get for a lab has to be perfect and if it isn’t then I failed was not
            easy for me. It has taken some work but I have come to terms with the reality that sometimes it just doesn't
            work. I have learned how to move past that and write about what we could have done differently or just say
            that it was out of our control. I still don’t like when things don’t work out but now I can accept that and
            move past it.
            <br><br>
            I have gotten a lot out of the science and technology opportunities at OWL. I have learned a lot about
            different scientific fields and how to operate in a scientific environment. Focusing on real experience in
            and out of the classroom has helped better my understanding of how science actually happens. Working on
            technology projects has given me a chance to help the greater school community and taught me about topics I
            am interested in but would not otherwise be able to learn about. I have become a better and more capable
            person thanks to what I have done in science and technology at OWL.
