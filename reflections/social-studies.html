        <h2>Social Studies Reflection</h2>
        <p class="refelection">
            My social studies classes at OWL have been somewhat limited but extremely fun. I have taken the 3 classes
            required to graduate, World History, Human Geo, and Gov, as well as electing to take APUSH over regular US
            History. Although I did not take any social studies electives I was still able to learn a lot about the
            aspects of social studies I am interested in.
            <br><br>
            I particularly enjoyed APUSH as a class. Its overall format of partly self directed learning of the content
            along with the more open class style lent itself very well to how I learn. The content was also particularly
            interesting to me. I struggle with finding motivation to work on subject matter that I do not find
            interesting but I never had that problem with APUSH. Especially the late 19th century and the early 20th
            include a lot of content I really enjoyed.
            <br><br>
            Social studies at OWL has been a good opportunity for me to make use of responsibility. Social studies
            summatives tend to be projects and not tests which means I need to do things on time. That is something I
            have trouble with so it takes a lot of work to keep up with it. I have had to take responsibility for my
            time management and work to make sure I can be successful. I have ended up mainly working on responsibility
            through social studies and it has really helped me.
            <br><br>
            I struggled with any time memorization was involved. I am almost unable to memorize specific facts on
            purpose. In general social studies classes could be taught with a focus on memorization which could be a
            huge problem for me but luckily OWL social studies avoid pure memorization for the most part. The broader
            perspective that my classes took really helped me with remembering facts by teaching them more in context.
            With context I can usually get to a fact if not pretty close so I was still able to do well. In APUSH there
            were a couple times that I never really got specifics into my head but those instances were sparse so the
            effects were mitigated.
            <br><br>
            I enjoyed my social studies classes at OWL. They taught me a lot about subjects I never would have thought
            to seek out but I ended up liking. At the same time I was able to refine my abilities to work on large
            projects and my time management. My classes in social studies have been an incredible experience.
