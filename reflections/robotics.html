        <h2>Robotics Reflection</h2>
        <p class="refelection">
            Robotics has been a big part of high school for me. Since our team re-started when I was in 9th grade we
            have done a lot. It is one of my favorite activities and has inspired me to dig deeper into many different
            fields that I now am considering for college. Through Robotics I have strengthened and formed many
            friendships and learned about many subjects ranging from electrical engineering to how to communicate with a
            team on long term projects. Robotics has been an integral part of my time at OWL.
            <br><br>
            At a base level Robotics has been very helpful to my journey in STEM. It combines mechanical and electrical
            engineering along with programming to create a finished product. Robotics has been a great opportunity for
            me to explore what the more physical side of engineering is at a higher level. After learning about the
            inner workings of the base robot design in 9th grade by wiring our robot, I decided to learn more about
            electrical engineering. I have since found many different resources and been able to experiment with a
            variety of personal projects with electricity. I have learned a ton about how computers work and what drives
            our everyday technology. With this new knowledge and understanding I was able to teach other members of the
            team more about how the wiring system works. The mechanical side of our robot was also new to me at first
            but after seeing it built in 9th grade and focusing on it myself in 11th I gained a better appreciation for
            the complexities of mechanical systems. Robotics has sparked my interest in both electrical and mechanical
            engineering and inspired me to look into both of these new fields in college.
            <br><br>
            Communication is an important part of Robotics and a vital skill for life. As I have worked on our team I
            have become a far better communicator. At the beginning of 9th grade I disliked talking to people I didn’t
            know and I usually struggled to get my point across accurately and concisely. Although it was not the only
            factor, Robotics was very important to my shift toward stronger and more confident communication. The team
            aspect of Robotics makes it very communication heavy. As a leader on the team I learned how to help people
            learn new things and how to explain concepts effectively. It was very rewarding to learn something myself
            and then be able to teach others how to do it. Working with other teams at competitions improved my ability
            to talk to people I don’t know. It gave me a chance to talk to new people in a welcoming and comfortable
            environment with given common ground. Especially when we needed to borrow a tool I found it easier than I
            usually do to talk to new people. That practice gave me more confidence in talking to people outside of
            robotics.
            <br><br>
            The hardest part of Robotics for me was learning how to not try to do everything. Delegation is important
            and one person is unable to do everything a team needs to do in such a short amount of time. I have always
            struggled with wanting to do everything because either I am excited or I think it will be easier. Robotics
            has made me realize that I do this and that I need to work on it. Especially when I am trying to help
            someone else learn something I need to let them work through things themself because that will help them
            really learn it. I am starting to get better at letting other people do things themself and focusing more on
            advising and helping them get better. It has been nice to be able to step back some and I have found that I
            enjoy guiding people forward.
            <br><br>
            What I love about Robotics is the chance for learning and experimenting in new areas. It helped me learn
            more about the subjects that I enjoy and become a better group member. I use a lot of what I learned at
            Robotics every day, be it through talking to and teaching people or just by working on personal engineering
            projects. Being able to help people learn about the subjects I love is a ton of fun and helps me to better
            my own understanding of them. The community associated with Robotics is amazing and I am proud to be a part
            of it.
