        <h2>English Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            The classes I took in the English department at OWL were limited. Although I took AP classes, I still only
            took the required 4: ELA 9, ELA 10, AP Lang, and AP Lit. For most of my life I did not enjoy writing and
            because of that I didn’t like English classes. I did enjoy reading however and that kept me still invested
            in my classes. Partway through high school I realized that I had never given writing a proper chance. I
            started to try to engage with my writing work to see if I could like it and it turns out I did. I have
            recently come into my voice as a writer and have started to appreciate writing as a way to express myself.
            <br><br>
            The class that really changed my mind about writing was AP Lang. I went into 11th grade knowing that I had a
            course load that was extremely writing intensive but I was optimistic. AP Lang was the push I needed to
            succeed. The timed writes we often did in class forced me to stop overthinking my words and just write
            without thinking. That was when I started to enjoy it, I was no longer stressed over every line and I was
            able to express my ideas just as easily as talking. The timed writes gave me a new perspective on writing
            and allowed me to try out different styles and refine my voice. It was a transformative experience that I am
            immensely grateful for.
            <br><br>
            English classes required a lot of perseverance. Before I came into my voice I struggled a lot with every
            assignment. For a long time English was definitely my worst subject but I worked through that and I was
            still able to get decent grades and keep up in class. Writing was a grueling task but that time taught me
            how to work on things I don’t want to do. It helped me learn to motivate myself and work with what I have.
            <br><br>
            Even with the ability to write, English is still my worst subject. It doesn’t come easily to me so I really
            have to work to do well and it can often be frustrating. I have had a lot of trouble staying up to date on
            my assignments and not falling behind. As I got more and more behind I got less and less motivated to work
            because the amount of things I had to do seemed insurmountable. Working through it each time was hard and I
            often needed help, often with helping me make a list and break down my work. I really don’t like to ask for
            help so the necessity that my classes sometimes created ended up helping me improve my ability to do so. I
            learned that even if I don’t want to I sometimes need to ask for help and it isn’t a bad thing. Although I
            still try not to, the ability to ask for help and to recognize when I need it is important.
            <br><br>
            My journey with English classes has been an interesting one. From never wanting to write and disliking my
            classes to loving to write and seeing it as vital to my communication I have learned a lot. The process of
            improving my writing skills took a long time to come into fruition but I am glad that I persevered and made
            it where I am now. In retrospect, I wish I had started writing properly sooner and taken more classes in
            English but it seems I’ll have to settle for just taking even more in the future.
