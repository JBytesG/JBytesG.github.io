        <h2>High School Reflection</h2>
        <p class="refelection">
            My high school experience has been an incredible opportunity to learn about a broad range of topics. From
            classes I enjoyed such as APCSP and AP Statistics to classes I liked less, I learned a lot about both the
            subject matter and how I can motivate myself and learn better. I also gained many valuable skills from my
            extracurriculars such as time management and better people skills.
            <br><br>
            I enjoyed many aspects of my time in high school. Opportunities to focus on what I wanted to with my
            elective classes were a big part of what made it so fun. Taking APCSP in 9th grade gave me the ability to
            take a computer science class before I could do PSEO. It helped me work on my programming skills in a
            structured class environment before I otherwise would have been able to. APCSP was also an all-around
            enjoyable class. PSEO and TAing enabled me to focus even more on what I wanted. Through TAing with Rhonda, I
            was able to help around school with many different problems which was very fulfilling. PSEO let me continue
            to work on computer science when I otherwise would not have been able to. It kept me motivated to work on
            other topics as well as let me make progress toward a java certification.
            <br><br>
            Throughout high school, I struggled with mainly one thing, procrastination. I have had a lot of trouble with
            deadlines and turning things in on time. It has led to a lot of cramming at the end of quarters and led me
            to not always get the grades I would have wanted. Over time I have learned about ways to deal with my
            procrastination habits and they are becoming less of an issue. Although I still have trouble I feel that I
            am making progress toward being a more productive person.
            <br><br>
            The extracurricular activities I have participated in span a wide range of topics and I have grown in many
            different ways thanks to them. Robotics has been an especially big part of my high school career. It has
            helped me get better at collaboration and communication while teaching me about the basics of creating
            robots. I have also participated in three different sports: Cross Country, Swimming, and Track. I primarily
            participate in sports as a way to be a part of the community of the team but I have also learned about
            dedication and perseverance. Additionally, they have helped me stay active and have given me a way to let
            out energy. The last extracurricular activity that has been a part of high school for me is Mock Trial.
            Through it, I have been able to branch out from my normal interests and push myself out of my comfort zone.
            The opportunity to learn about the legal system while becoming a better communicator has been amazing for me
            and has enhanced my overall experience.
            <br><br>
            High school has been extremely helpful to me. It has given me a chance to learn and grow in an environment
            where it was safe to make mistakes. I have learned many things about myself that I can apply to anything I
            do in the future.
