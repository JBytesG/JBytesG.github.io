        <h2>Personal Development Reflection</h2>
        <p class="refelection">
            Over the course of high school I have changed a lot. From academic things, like learning how to write well
            and work through logical problems, all the way to more abstract things, like how to help other people learn
            and effectively communicate. As a person, A majority of my growth has been becoming more social and
            outspoken. Going into high school I never would have anticipated what I would be like on the other side.
            <br><br>
            In 9th grade I was wildly different socially from how I am now. I began 9th grade having just built up the
            confidence to be able to text at all and even that was difficult. As I have progressed through the past
            couple years I slowly gained confidence in myself through many different activities. After lots of effort I
            have become far better and I have started to be able to really express myself and even talk to people that I
            don’t know. A big part in my development was the pandemic, shockingly enough. It made me realize that I did
            want to talk to people and I just hadn’t been able to. Coming back to seeing people face to face, everyone
            was not used to the social landscape. That made my struggle with navigating it feel less awkward and allowed
            me to practice more without feeling as self conscious. I am still improving and working to be better. I
            still have a lot of trouble with calling and sending emails to people I don’t know, but I have improved a
            lot. I am very proud of how far I have come socially over the course of high school.
            <br><br>
            A big part of high school was just what everyone says, self discovery. I learned a lot about myself but one
            of the most important things was recognizing that I have ADHD. I have always had a lot of trouble with
            completing things without deadlines and finishing things once I start. For the most part I just thought I
            had no motivation and was lazy. After connecting a lot of what I experienced to ADHD and talking to my
            doctor I learned that was not the case. Once I knew that I was able to find ways to deal with a lot of the
            problems I was having. It made me feel better about myself knowing that it wasn’t just an issue of laziness.
            I have since become far more productive and utilizing my new strategies I have been able to do work that I
            am proud of before the day of deadlines.
            <br><br>
            I enjoy solving problems and helping people. That means that I always try to fix issues that people are
            having for them which can be good but definitely isn’t always the best thing to do. Learning how to do
            things for yourself is very important and I have found that I also enjoy helping others learn. I have
            struggled with balancing when different kinds of help are best. It is something that I have been trying to
            work on but I still sometimes forget and will end up taking over other people’s projects by accident.
            Through activities like Robotics I have been able to get a better idea of when I should focus more on
            teaching and less on doing. This process has been a pretty long one and I am nowhere near done but I have
            started to improve. I feel that I am beginning to help people in a more meaningful way than just directly
            fixing problems.
            <br><br>
            For me, high school has been a helpful place to learn and grow. I have been able to better myself both in
            and out of the classroom. It has been a very good opportunity to find things that were preventing me from
            functioning on the level that I wanted and to find ways around those issues. I am grateful for all the
            possibilities that my development in high school have opened up and I cannot wait to continue becoming
            better as I explore new horizons.
