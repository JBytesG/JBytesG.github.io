        <h2>Post High School Reflection</h2>
        <p class="refelection">
            I plan on going to college in the near future. Currently, I think I will be studying computer science with
            some additional classes in electrical/computer engineering and mechanical engineering. I am very excited to
            participate in robotics clubs and work in maker spaces. Joining clubs is something I really look forward to
            doing in the next couple of years. They will allow me to make many connections and participate in what I
            enjoy doing easily while being an active member of my school’s community. For work through college I would
            like to work in a position similar to my current TA, doing tech help around the school. I really enjoy
            helping people and solving problems and since I have technology skills it’s easy to do that with a genius
            squad style of job.
            <br><br>
            After college, I think I will be doing some sort of software development job. Since I enjoy almost every
            aspect of programming it makes sense that I would get a job doing it. In addition to my job, I would like to
            continue pursuing some kind of education. It would likely consist of online classes of some kind with the
            goal of just continuing to learn and expand as a person. Whatever form it comes in I plan to continue
            learning. Personal projects are another thing I would like to continue with after college. I enjoy working
            on a wide variety of technology projects in my spare time and I don’t plan on stopping anytime soon. In fact
            with more freedom, I will likely expand my projects and be even more ambitious with them.
            <br><br>
            In 10 years I see myself being pretty similar to my post-college self but with some more experience. I would
            expect to be in a similar position career-wise and hopefully rather comfortable with it. The only major
            difference I could think of is I would hopefully be able to try and teach other people about my feilds at
            technology conferences or some other similar forum.
