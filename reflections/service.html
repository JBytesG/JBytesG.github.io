        <h2>Service Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            When I first learned about the service requirement at OWL it seemed impossible to meet. I had no idea how I
            would meet it. It turned out to not be as hard as I thought, all I had to do was find something I could do
            for service that I enjoy and it just happened naturally. Almost all of my community service hours are from
            volunteering as a counselor at the summer camp Adventures in Cardboard (AiC) for two summers. My school
            service was primarily through my TA with Rhonda and working on tech around the school.
            <br><br>
            Over the summers before 9th and 10th grade I worked in a volunteer position at AiC. It was something I would
            have done anyways as it is part of becoming a full counselor but since it was so much time it worked out
            well for the community service requirement. I did a lot at AiC, I learned the responsibilities of a
            counselor and how things were run behind the scenes. There were many times where I stepped in when someone
            was out sick and it was a good chance for me to get a better idea of what I wanted to do at camp in the
            future. I was able to be a part of the AiC community while helping out and learning more about the function
            of camp.
            <br><br>
            In the first semester of my 11th grade year at OWL I realized that I could help people at school with tech
            issues in an official capacity. I started TAing with Rhonda in second semester and since then I have done a
            lot. In addition to doing more basic tasks such as iPad setup and troubleshooting I was able to go through
            our tech storage spaces and clean out old things to make space for random tech that didn’t have a place to
            go. By rearranging and clearing out space I managed to help organize and streamline our storage and clear up
            usable areas in Rhonda’s room for people to use. I have also worked with other teachers to set up live
            streaming and recording for many different school events.
            <br><br>
            Service was a big thing I worried about when I was younger. Looking back I feel like I have had a good
            impact on both my school and community. I am glad that the service requirement made me search out
            opportunities to help. I had a chance to do things that had a real impact. Service has enhanced my time at
            OWL beyond just helping people, it taught me the importance of seeking out needs and finding solutions. In
            the words of Bigweld from Robots (2005) “See a need, fill a need.”
